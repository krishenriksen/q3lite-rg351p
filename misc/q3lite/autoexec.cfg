// Binds

// These binds are minimal just to get you up and running.  You can adjust
// player movements in the game menu under Setup > Controls, however those
// settings will be nullified by any binds that you set here.  You'll probably
// want to set all of your key bindings here so you don't lose them in the
// event that the ~/.q3a/baseq3/q3config.cfg file gets overwritten or deleted.

// Cvars
//
// If the cvar description begins with the word "Toggle" then settings for the
// cvar are typically 0 = disable/off, 1 = enable/on.  You can use the "toggle"
// command to change the value of a cvar from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0. This can be
// combined with the "bind" command to bind a keyboard key to toggle a cvar setting.
// Example: bind q "toggle cl_noprint"
//
// If the cvar description begins with the word "Set" then settings for the cvar
// fall within a range of settings.
//
// If the cvar is commented out (line begins with //) then the cvar is either
// read only or it should be set on the OS command line rather than here.
// Set player command line cvars in /usr/local/bin/q3lite.
